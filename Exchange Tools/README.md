# BEC Caution Script v0.1

This is a pretty straightforward tool that is design to be set on a schedule (Hourly, daily, weekly, manual, up to you). 

Just run it each time and it'll poll your latest list of mailbox names and display a small banner indicating that it is not likely friendly. 

Comments welcome. 

### Read the code before running

Instructions: 

1. Save this PS1 and the content folder on an Exchange Server
2. Modify the example to include a sample user base from a distribution list (IT@domain.com) 
3. Set a Scheduled Task to run it again every X
