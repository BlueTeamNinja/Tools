# Tools
A few things I've slapped together over time.  I hope you find them useful.
For you blueberries, just [Download](https://github.com/BlueTeamNinja/Tools/archive/master.zip "The path to greatness")  from here.  

**Script** | What it does... | Requisites
---|---|---:
||<h2> *AD Tools* |
**Send-SMSAlert** | Because a tsunami of emails **AFTER** you've fixed exchange saying "*Exchange is down*" is just embarassing.  | *None*
||<h2> General Tools|
**Intentional-Lockout** |  Locks out a specified account.  Used to test Event alerting, WMI query testing, and SIEM trigger. | *None*
**Mass E-Mailer** | *Coming soon*, internal tool for emailing Powershell outputs in bulk, grouped by an item (Usually a person, group by Supervisors etc).  | *NA*
**Open Ports** | _Netstat is boring_.  Lucky for you, I'm not.  I just added a bit of tweak for some decent info for listening ports. | *None*
